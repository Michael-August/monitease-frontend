## üòä: **Welcome to JK Holdings**

Hi and thanks for joining, This is an applicationto help organizations monitor the processes and activities easily (monitEase), more like an inventory system. To aid your contribution to this project, I have decided to help you on how to set this project up on your local machine, so you can focus on contributing as soon as possible.

## :milky_way: **Technologies Used**

- Angular 13
- Bootstrap
- Apex chart
- ngx-pagination etc

If you are not familiar with any of these technologies or it has been a while you worked with any of them, it is recommended you take some time to refresh your memory.

Getting started with contributing on this project is very simple, I have done this so that you can focus on building the product and not get distracted with setting up the project.
The first thing you need to do is to clone the repository into your local machine.

```bash
  # Clone the application to your local machine
  foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/Michael-August/monitease-frontend.git
```
After this you can choose to get started contributing by running it directly on your local machine.

### :snail: Local Setup

To set this up on your machine, make sure that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), [npm](https://npmjs.com) and angular cli installed on your local machine. After establishing that you have NodeJS installed and angular cli installed, navigate into the cloned project directory and follow the steps below:

```bash
  # Navigate into the client directory
  foo@bar:~$ cd moniEase

  # Install the packages
  foo@bar:~$ npm install
  
  # Run the application in development
  foo@bar:~$ ng serve
```
